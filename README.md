## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- This is my first project after a year or two break.
- I learned I should be focusing more on Mobile-first development, which I didn't implement here very well. I don't actually think it needs it here, but not having it at least be a thought is something I should work on.

### Continued development

- On continuing development, I'd like to be able to use better practices, and also learn the workflow of Github going forward.
